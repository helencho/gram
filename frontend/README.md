# Frontend

This holds the frontend components for Sinistagram. If you want to run just the frontend, follow these instructions: 

```
git clone
npm install
npm start
```

View it in `localhost:3000`

FYI, all assets and images are stored in the backend, so you won't see much :information_desk_person:.
